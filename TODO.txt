Identified Tasks
================

1. Integrate more of the 3rd party library tests
** integrate tests from antimarkdown
** integrate tests from markdownify

2. step "4b" in `to_markdown` should be eliminated
	in this step, we alter the existing dom to swap the ``TokenHR`` with (``TokenNewline``, ``TokenHR``(stripped), ``TokenNewline``)
	a better approach would be to surround the ``TokenHR`` in a special block
	
	``TokenProtectedBlock``
	
	this could potentially be applied to ``TokenHN`` too
	
	``TokenProtectedBlock`` would protect the contents from having their newlines adjusted
	
	for example:

		TokenProtectedBlock
		TokenHR
		TokenProtectedBlock
		TokenNewlines(2)
		TokenCharacters
		
	when analyzing the above for cleanup, The TokenNewlines(2) would consolidate to a TokenNewslines(1) but not be able to alter the TokenProtectedBlock

3. Bold+Italic text
	three asterisk/underscore
	a `character_italicbold` customization hook was added, however it is not rendered.  this requires searching in/out of the tags (like with a/img tags and code blocks)
	perhaps this can be solved with a regex?

4. are we escaping characters correctly?

5. can there be some performance improvements?

6. strip attributes from html tags and/or use a callable function like bleach

## Local Markdown Links

The form of absolute links is supported:

	<https://example.com/path/to>

However, local links in this form WILL NOT be supported:

	</path/to>

This is because they look like end tags and html5lib parses them as such.

Correctly supporting this would be a major undertaking.
