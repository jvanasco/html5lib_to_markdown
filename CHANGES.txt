0.0.6
  * fixed an error where allowed tags, such as `a` and `img`, were not
    processed correctly. this is was due to the logic sections used to clean
    the `data` payloads when (i) leading and (ii) trailing spaces were not
    present, a (i) lstrip and (ii) rstrip were attempted. in the instance of
    an allowed tag, the `data` payloads are not a parsed markdown element but
    instead an `OrderedDict`.
  * changed some default values
  * added test cases to protect against the a/img bug
